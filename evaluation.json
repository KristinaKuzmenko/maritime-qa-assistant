To resolve this issue:\n\n**Causes and Solutions:**\n\n- Pressure regulator (TR) wrongly adjusted: Adjust to correct pressure between 0.8 and 2.0 Bar, depending on W.O oil viscosity.\n- Failure in air supply: Check the compressed air supply system to the incinerator.\n- Pressure control (PS3) wrongly adjusted: Adjust to correct range of 0.8 Bar minimum.\n- Valves in air-pipe system closed: Inspect and open all valves in the air supply line.\n- Filter for air (OL) obstructed: Clean or replace the air filter.\n\nAfter addressing the root cause, reset the alarm through the control panel. Proper atomizing air pressure is critical for efficient W.O combustion and flame stability.\n\n[TABLE1] [Incinerator | Atomizing Air Pressure Failure | Page 98]",

As the crankshaft moves, oil is forced through restricted passages between the chambers, transforming vibration energy into hydraulic damping. This stabilizes shaft motion and reduces stress on the bearings.",

Uneven wear becomes evident when inserting a ring into the bore and checking clearance variations. Early overhaul is justified when ring sealing is lost, blow-by increases, ring failures appear before scheduled intervals, measured wear approaches the documented percentage limit, or ovality exceeds roughly one millimeter causing rapid deterioration of piston overhaul frequency.",

Longitudinal scratches caused by poorly fitted stuffing box rings reduce sealing. Coarser damage may require machining because ring contact is no longer uniform.

From the scavenge air space you measure the piston skirt–liner clearance fore and aft using a long feeler gauge. For a finer check you mount a digital dial gauge under the aft side of the skirt, zero it on the liner surface, then compare readings taken at the specified crank positions to assess symmetry. If the piston favors one side you adjust guide strip shimming until fore-and-aft clearance values match and maintain parallelism within the prescribed tolerance.",

    "answer": {
      "answer_text": "Reciprocating parts clearances must be checked with the engine positioned so that all components are unloaded, aligned and accessible for accurate measurement. \n\n1. Turn the crankshaft ASTERN past BDC until the piston skirt is positioned 150–200 mm below the cylinder liner bottom. Ensure the guide shoe rests correctly on the crosshead guide. In this position, verify piston centering by checking PF and PA skirt-to-liner clearances from the scavenge space using a long feeler.\n\n2. Mount a dial gauge underneath the stuffing box so its tip touches the piston rod and zero the gauge. Record the R1 value once the rod is stable. The dial gauge must be positioned at the bottom flange point specified in the work card.\n\n3. Confirm correct guide shoe height: approximately 100 mm above the chamfered area of the guide plane, with the crankthrow and connecting rod positioned to ensure the required geometric clearance.\n\n4. Measure guide clearances E1–H4 around the guide shoes with feelers at all designated locations. Measurements must be taken with the crosshead fully supported and square in the frame.\n\n5. Before measuring ZF and ZA (fore and aft clearance between connecting rod and crankthrow), turn the crankshaft ASTERN to 35° before TDC. At this crank angle, measure ZF and ZA at the machined surfaces where the clearances are smallest.\n\nThese conditions ensure that alignment, piston position and support forces are correct so that all reciprocating-part clearances can be measured accurately.",

    "answer": {
      "answer_text": "When switching from BN70 to BN100 cylinder oil, the ACC factor must be reduced because BN100 provides higher neutralization capacity. The correct method is to scale the original ACC(BN70) value by the BN ratio 70/100. This preserves the same acid-neutralizing capability in operation. Example: if the engine has been operating with ACC(BN70) = 0.26, then ACC(BN100) = 0.26 × 70/100 = 0.18. This relationship is confirmed by the feed-rate correlation table showing equivalent ACC values for BN70, BN80, BN90, and BN100 oils. The Fe/BN-vs-ACC diagrams further illustrate why a higher BN requires a proportionally lower ACC: increasing BN shifts the neutralization curve upward, so the optimal ACC point moves downward to maintain the same liner protection without over-lubrication.",

    "answer": {
      "answer_text": "The transition from safe into critical corrosion levels is identified when scavenge drain-oil iron (Fe) rises toward and beyond roughly 200 mg/kg. Fe values below about 200 mg/kg fall within the safe wear region, where corrosive attack remains limited. Once Fe crosses this threshold, wear accelerates sharply, indicating that the liner surface is exposed to active corrosion. At the same time, BN depletion into the low range (approximately 0–10 mg KOH/g) shows that the oil’s neutralizing capacity is no longer sufficient. A stable BN window of about 10–25 mg KOH/g correlates with controlled Fe levels. When Fe rises above 200 mg/kg while BN drops into the red zone, the engine has entered a critical corrosion condition requiring immediate lubrication adjustments.",

This pressure forces the ring down into its groove and outward against the liner surface, closing the clearance between piston and liner and forming a dynamic seal during the stroke. The seal depends on the ring’s ability to respond instantly to pressure changes and maintain uniform contact with the liner.\n\nOptimal sealing requires: \n- correct geometry of rings, ring grooves and the cylinder liner, ensuring proper contact and load distribution; \n- free axial and radial movement of each ring in its groove so the ring can follow piston motion without sticking; \n- clean ring grooves with correct clearances, verified through inspection, to avoid carbon packing and impaired ring mobility; \n- adequate lubrication to stabilise the oil film, limit wear and prevent scuffing, as lubrication quality directly influences the ring’s ability to maintain a tight gas seal.\n\nThese conditions ensure stable sealing, controlled wear and minimal blow-by throughout operation.",

This requires checking the mist catcher function.\n- Normal sludge (SLUDGE – S): Considered a normal condition and indicates healthy cylinder performance and balanced lubrication.\n- Heavy sludge (MUCH SLUDGE – MS): Indicates excessive oil and carbon accumulation.

    "answer": {
      "answer_text": "Carbon build-up on piston crown lands can occur even when lubrication feed rates are nominal because the primary cause is not oil quantity but insufficient gas sealing at the piston rings. When a ring does not seal correctly, combustion gases pass behind it and deposit carbon on the ring-land area. MAN specifies that carbon accumulated on the land above a piston ring indicates poor gas sealing at that ring. Restricted ring movement, carbon in the grooves, or incorrect groove clearances reduce the pressure transfer behind the ring and lower its outward sealing force, allowing blow-by and deposit formation.\n\nAdditional combustion-related factors can worsen the deposits regardless of oil feed rate. Faulty fuel valves or insufficient turbocharger performance may overheat or disrupt the cylinder oil film on the crown and ring lands, promoting hard carbon formation. Thick, polished deposits may locally wipe away the oil film, increasing the risk of bore polishing, micro-seizure and accelerated wear. The piston cleaning ring normally removes excess deposits, but when blow-by and abnormal combustion dominate, deposits can exceed normal levels even with correct lubrication.",

Grinding is then carried out in small depth steps, typically up to 0.2 mm at a time, following the machine supplier’s manual. The aim is to remove blow-by marks and reduce individual dent marks to less than 2 mm in diameter while grinding as little as possible. Preventive grinding should not exceed 0.5 mm in depth, and the total grinding depth must not surpass the maximum limit G1 given in the work card, currently 2 mm for MAN B&W 30–98 bore engines. If acceptable surface condition cannot be achieved within this depth, MAN Energy Solutions must be consulted about further reconditioning.",

      "answer_text": "When increasing engine load after running for an extended period at low load, the LWM setpoints must be readjusted to prevent false alarms. Tmax must be reset to match the new load level, and both Tmax and ΔTmaxdev must be placed as low and as close to the actual sensor temperature band as possible to avoid premature triggering. At low loads, ΔTmaxdev must be reduced because the allowed deviation between sensors is naturally smaller.\n\nAfter prolonged low-load operation, a short period of temperature instability must be expected when load is increased to 85%. This is caused by rapid changes in piston ring geometry and contact conditions, and the pattern and magnitude of the temperature fluctuations cannot be predicted. Temperatures may oscillate for a short period until stability is restored.\n\nIn practice, Tmax is set slightly above the observed temperature peak (for example peak + 5 °C), and ΔTmaxdev is set slightly above the observed peak-to-average difference to provide margin for transient spikes during load changes.",

Turn the piston to TDC so the crown is clear of the liner, clean the lifting groove and mount the normal piston lifting tool so the claws fully enter the lifting grooves and the crane hook is correctly seated on the tool dowel pin. [Main Engine Vol 1 | Piston — Dismantling — Piston lifting tool | Page 551]\n\nLift the piston out of the cylinder liner and guide the piston rod foot through the stuffing box flange. Always use lifting gear with sufficient SWL and keep clear of the piston during the lift. If long distance pieces are fitted for the stuffing box, the piston rod foot can pass between two cylinder cover studs. Place the two halves of the piston support tool around one of the openings in the platform, lower the piston rod foot and stuffing box through the opening, secure the two support halves with screws and lower the piston until it rests on the piston rod flange. The piston and support must not be left on the gallery during engine operation. [Main Engine Vol 1 | Piston — Dismantling — Piston lift and support (T22-078) | Page 552]\n\nFor tilting, lower the piston rod foot onto a wooden block and land the piston crown on a wooden block on the platform so the lifting tool can be removed. Attach the lifting bracket to the bottom of the piston rod foot and hook the crane onto the lifting bracket. Lift the piston rod foot clear of the wooden block and keep lifting until the piston rod is vertical. During this lift, follow with the crane so the hook remains vertically above the lifting point and ensure the stuffing box has been removed beforehand to avoid damage.

If water content is higher, tin-aluminium crosshead bearings with a lead overlay are especially vulnerable. Excessive water causes rapid corrosion of the lead overlay, after which the underlying bearing material is exposed and wear accelerates dramatically. Main and crankpin bearings, whether white metal or tin-aluminium, can also suffer irreparable damage from water contamination, but the damage mechanism is less acute than for crosshead bearings. To prevent this, a Water in Oil Monitoring system continuously measures water activity in the oil and is connected to the alarm system.

Examine the bearing shell for wiped areas, overheating signs, discoloration or bearing metal displacement. If the bearing shell requires replacement, remove the complete bearing cap and use tackles both inside the frame box and outside the crankcase to lift the cap out. \nAdditionally, check the oil pan and filters for bearing metal fragments and perform bearing-edge checks to identify the damaged unit. Afterwards, take crankshaft deflection readings under nearly identical temperature and load conditions to determine whether the crankshaft has distorted due to the bearing failure.",

    "answer": {
      "answer_text": "The minimum cylinder oil feed rate is defined as 0.6 g/kWh, which is the amount required to provide sufficient lubrication for all parts. Increasing the feed rate above the optimum does not significantly increase the oil film thickness once the optimum point has been reached. In service, the recommended method of optimisation is to monitor cylinder condition continually through scavenge port inspections and drain-oil analysis. By correlating observed wear, deposits and corrosion with feed rate and fuel sulphur content, the crew adjusts the dosage so that consumption is minimised while maintaining safe wear margins.",

    "answer": {
      "answer_text": "The ACOM system automatically mixes two fully formulated cylinder oils of different BN values to achieve an optimal BN that matches the sulphur content in the fuel. The engine control system receives the sulphur content of the fuel, or calculates the Sulphur Equivalent (Se) in gas-mode operation based on engine load, pilot-oil quantity and pilot-fuel sulphur content. Using this Se value, the ACOM adjusts the mixing ratio of the two stored cylinder oils so that the blended oil has the BN required for the actual sulphur level. Mixing volumes are kept small to enable rapid changeover when the fuel sulphur content changes, and the system is located near and above the engine cylinder-oil inlet flange so that gravity feed can be used.",

The crankcase and oil pan should be inspected for traces of melted white metal. After corrective actions, the mechanic must perform repeated temperature and condition checks of the bearings 15–30 minutes after restart, one hour after, and again at full load to confirm that all bearings are operating normally.",

Fuel oil, lubricating oil, hydraulic power supply and associated auxiliary systems must be properly shut off or set in stand-by to eliminate external influences on pressure regulation. After confirming these prerequisites, verify that the fuel supply pressure is stable and that no air is present in the suction side. Inspect filters and strainers and ensure that the circulating and control systems are not affected by conditions listed in the same table, as they directly impact injection behavior. If commanded injection pressure remains too low, inspect the pump element for internal leakage, verify sealing integrity, and ensure temperature-dependent viscosity is within acceptable operating limits. Any component showing wear or leakage must be repaired or replaced based on the findings.",

Disconnect and plug the closing-air line at the slow-turning valve and manually open the valve while observing the indicator cocks. Any air discharge indicates leakage past the starting-air valves and requires overhaul. Rotate the engine 180° and repeat the procedure to confirm leakage under a second crank position. Next, verify correct pilot-air actuation by selecting channel 50 from the ECR while observing spring movement in the valve. If irregular motion or air leakage persists, follow the removal steps shown in the referenced work card: remove control-air and main-air connections, shut off the exhaust-valve air supply, and disconnect electrical connections from the control block. Components showing sticking, worn sealing surfaces or incorrect response must be cleaned, inspected and reassembled or renewed in accordance with the work instructions.",

Ensure the turbocharger receives correct oil pressure, flow and temperature, as reductions in any of these will cause bearing overheating. Review oil-quality properties in the analysis table (page 837): high TAN or SAN levels, water contamination, elevated insolubles or ash content, and excessive BN can all reduce oil film integrity and lead to rising bearing temperatures. Inspect filters, coolers and circulation paths for blockage. Verify that oil return lines are free of restrictions and that no sludge or lacquer deposits—referenced in the BN and insoluble descriptions—have accumulated. If temperatures remain high, inspect the bearing seats and lubrication passages for wear or fouling, clean or recondition them as specified, and reassemble with correct lubrication prior to restart.",

Inspect the piston rod, lower cylinder wall, piston skirt, piston rings, ring lands, and the piston top as the piston moves downwards. Examine each ring individually and document wear, damage or sticking.\n\nTo evaluate the piston's alignment and under-piston clearances, read the digital dial gauge installed under the piston skirt and record the clearance between the piston skirt and the liner. Use these readings to determine piston inclination (R1 − R2) and adjust guide-strip clearance to achieve symmetrical alignment relative to the skirt–liner clearance.

Assemble the ring units, check and correct their alignment, fit the O-rings, and land the stuffing box on the flange ensuring that the holes in the stuffing box and flange are correctly centred. Tighten the fitted bolts and standard bolts to the specified torque. After mounting, lubricate the piston rod again with MoS₂, turn the engine a few revolutions to seat the rings, then run the engine at very slow or idle speed for approximately fifteen minutes.

    "question": "What steps must be followed to inspect the XH Bearings after a vibration event?",
    "answer": {
      "answer_text": "Begin by carrying out an open-up inspection and record the hydraulic pressure at the moment the bearing cap nuts begin to loosen. Clean the running surfaces of the journal and the bearing shell thoroughly using a clean rag and a strong inspection lamp. Evaluate the metal condition and the journal surface according to the inspection guidelines. Examine the XH overlayer for signs of tearing, which will appear as sharply defined borders; small non-interconnecting tears are cosmetic only. Check for wiping, where parts of the overlayer smear out. For XH bearings incorporating a nickel intermediate layer, apply the knife test — the blade should leave only a faint or no mark in the intermediate layer. Upon completing the inspection, document all findings in the engine logbook in accordance with the prescribed recording instructions and drawing 2555-0140.",

      "answer_text": "The documentation describes the oil cooler in relation to flushing, contamination removal, preheating, and venting. Pipes, coolers and tanks must be thoroughly cleaned before filling the system. Flushing is performed using lube-oil centrifuges and fine filters down to 10 μm. During flushing, all system oil must circulate at 60–65°C with turbulent flow (Re ≥ 3000). Several engine components must be bypassed, including bearings, crossheads, turbochargers, torsional dampers and chain drives. Preheating of the circulating oil cooler is done by filling its waterside with fresh water and applying steam. During preheating, the deaerating (vent) pipe must remain open to keep the cooler pressure low. Cleanliness is verified using control bags positioned at the ends of the main lube-oil lines.",
